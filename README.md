## Takeaways 💡

I learned to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, refactoring an existing RESTful API.

I leanred to modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

I learned to create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
